# Magical-Note Using JavaScript
Created My magical Notes where i can add my notes. I have implemented a filter on these notes which can find and notes even if i have 1000+ notes in my document.
In my magical notes i made use of localStorage which will not erase my data even when the page is reloaded. 
It mean without using ang backend i am able to restore all my previous data and in case any note passes the dead line it can be deleted immediately.
